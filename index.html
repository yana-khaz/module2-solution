<h1>Gods in Norse Mythology</h1>

        <p>Odin</p>
      </div>
      <p class="content">Odin is one of the most complex and enigmatic characters in Norse mythology, and perhaps in all of world literature. He’s a war-god, but also a poetry-god, and he has prominent “effeminate” qualities that would have brought unspeakable shame to any historical Viking warrior. He’s worshiped by those in search of prestige, honor, and nobility, yet he’s often cursed for being a fickle trickster.</p>

      <div class="head", id="id2">
        <p>Thor</p>
      </div>
      <p class="content">Thor is one of the most prominent figures in Norse mythology. He was a major god of all branches of the Germanic peoples before their conversion to Christianity, although he reached the height of his popularity among the Scandinavians of the late Viking Age.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <div class="head", id="id3">
        <p>Loki</p>
      </div>
      <p class="content">Loki is the wily trickster god of Norse mythology. While treated as a nominal member of the gods, Loki occupies a highly ambivalent and ultimately unique position among the gods, giants, and the other kinds of spiritual beings that populate the pre-Christian Norse religion.</p>
